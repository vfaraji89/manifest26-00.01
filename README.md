# Manifest 2026-00.01 

> *"From having nothing but hunger to learn."*

## What is this?

This is my **New Year Manifest for 2026** - a deeply personal commitment to constant learning, human-centric building, and giving back to the communities that gave me everything.

## Why 00.01?

**00.01** represents the very first minute of the new year - **January 1st, 2026 at 00:01**.

But it's more than a timestamp. It's a philosophy:

- **Constant work** - Like the clock moving from 00.01 to 00.02 to 00.03, we work continuously
- **Always beginning** - Every minute is a fresh start, a new opportunity
- **Never waiting** - Not 00.00, because we don't wait. We begin. We build. We move forward.

## My Story 📖

In high school, I didn't have a bag. I didn't have extra books (except formal educational books). I didn't have the resources that others took for granted.

Today, I have **GitHub**. I have **millions of repositories**. I have **GitHub Copilot as my teacher**. I have access to the same knowledge as anyone in Silicon Valley - **for free**.

**This is what equal opportunity looks like.**

## What I'm Committing To 

- **Work constantly** (00.01, 00.02, 00.03...) - Small progress every day
- **Stay human-centric** - Build technology that serves people
- **Give back generously** - Share code, knowledge, and time freely
- **Create equal opportunities** - Help others who face the barriers I once faced
- **Never forget where I came from** - The kid with no bag, no books, but infinite hunger to learn

## Thank You 

- **GitHub** - For being my infinite library, always open, always free
- **GitHub Copilot** - For being my coach, my teacher, my AI pair programmer
- **Open Source Community** - For building bridges where there were walls
- **Every developer who chose to share** - You changed my life

If you think you don't have the right education, resources, or background to be in tech...


## The First Green Square 🟩

This repository contains my first commit of 2026 - the first green square on my contribution graph for the year.

It represents showing up. Building. Learning. Growing.

**Let this be the first of many.** 🟩🟩🟩
